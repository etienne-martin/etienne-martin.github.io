Synchronous JavaScript is pretty straight forward to reason about, you type in some code, and it runs sequentially until it's done.

## For Each

I remember being absolutely confused the first time I wrote the following code.

```javascript
const slowOperation = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
};

[1, 2, 3].forEach(async () => {
  console.log("Fired!");
  await slowOperation();
  console.log("Resolved.");
});

console.log("We're done right?");
```

## Maps

```javascript
const slowOperation = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
};

await Promise.all(
  [1, 2, 3].map(async () => {
    console.log("Fired!");
    await slowOperation();
    console.log("Resolved.");
  })
);

console.log("We're done!");
```

## For loops

```javascript
const slowOperation = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
};

for (const item of [1, 2, 3]) {
  console.log("Fired!");
  await slowOperation();
  console.log("Resolved.");
}

console.log("We're done!");
```

## Dependencies between calls

Let's say you have multiple asynchronous operations that depend on the result of other promises,
the short answer is that you can't take advantage of parallelism and you have wait sequentially.

```javascript
const slowIncrement = (num) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(num + 1), 500));
};

const op1 = await slowIncrement(0);
const op2 = await slowIncrement(op1);
const op3 = await slowIncrement(op2);

console.log(op1, op2, op3);
```

With this you get a waterfall effect. There's not much you can do about it to make it faster.

Sometimes this is more subtle than that. Depending on the dependencies between calls you can sometimes parallelize _some_ parts of the code while keeping others waiting:

```javascript
const slowOperation = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
};

const pendingOp1 = slowOperation();

const op2 = await slowOperation();

const [op3, op1] = await Promise.all([slowOperation(op2), pendingOp1]);

console.log(op1, op2, op3);
```

## Error handling

Should be fulfilled

```javascript
await Promise.reject(43).catch(() => {
  return 1;
});
console.log("123");
```

Should be rejected

```javascript
await Promise.reject(43);
console.log("123");
```

Should be rejected too

```javascript
throw new Error("awd");
console.log("123");
```

Should log an unhandled promise

```javascript
Promise.reject(43);
console.log("123");
```
