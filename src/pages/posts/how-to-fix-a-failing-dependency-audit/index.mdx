A dependency audit is performed as part of every build in Jenkins. This allows us to spot new vulnerabilities as they
occur. Builds will fail when vulnerabilities are discovered to avoid merging code that contains known vulnerabilities.

How to fix the dreaded "Vulnerability Found" error message.

## How to run an audit

Run this command to perform a vulnerability audit against the installed packages:

```bash
yarn audit-packages
```

## How to patch a vulnerability

### 1. Identify the vulnerable package(s)

You can do this by running the following command `yarn audit-packages`. This will output something:

```
Vulnerability Found:

  Severity: MODERATE
  Modules: axios>follow-redirects
  URL: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pw2r-vq6v-hr8c
```

In this example, we can see that the `follow-redirects` module is the culprit. However, it's not a direct dependency, it
is used indirectly by `axios`.

### 2. Identify affected package version(s)

Open the advisory link in your browser. This will show you which versions of the package are affected and if a patch has
been released.

### 3. Upgrade the dependency

#### Direct dependencies

If the affected package is a direct dependency (i.e. a package that's listed in your `package.json`), upgrade the package
to its latest _patch_ version. Be careful if you decide to bump to a _major_ version as this will likely
introduce breaking changes that could require some refactoring.

Run the following command to upgrade a direct dependency:

```bash
yarn add <package-name>@^<patched-version>
```

#### Nested dependencies

Things get a little trickier if the affected package is nested in our dependency tree as we won't be able to upgrade the
package directly. The first thing to do is to check if we can indirectly update the vulnerable package by updating
direct dependencies that rely on it.

Run the following command to upgrade a direct dependency that relies on a vulnerable package:

```bash
yarn add <package-name>@^<patched-version>
```

This is not always feasible for newer vulnerabilities. We may be depending on a package that is not updated frequently,
which depends on another package that is causing our security audit to fail. In this case, if the version range
specified by our direct dependency does not cover the new sub-dependency version, we are stuck waiting for the author.

In such cases we can force yarn to resolve a different version of a nested dependency by
adding a `resolutions` field to our `package.json` and defining our version overrides:

```diff
 {
   "name": "web-app-ssr",
   "version": "2.0.1",
   "dependencies": {
     "axios": "^0.25.0"
   },
+  "resolutions": {
+    "follow-redirects": "^1.14.8"
+  }
 }
```

Make sure to specify the latest _patch_ version when changing a module's resolution. Upgrading to a _major_ version
might break some of our direct dependencies if they are not compatible with the newly specified version.

It is preferable to be specific when changing yarn's module resolution. If we have multiple dependencies relying on
multiple versions of a same package and only one of the dependency depends on a vulnerable version, it is preferable to
override only the vulnerable version by specifying an explicit resolution instead of overriding a version project-wide.

```diff
 {
   "name": "web-app-ssr",
   "version": "2.0.1",
   "dependencies": {
     "axios": "^0.25.0"
   },
+  "resolutions": {
+    "axios/follow-redirects": "^1.14.8"
+  }
 }
```

#### Ignoring a vulnerability

Sometimes there are no patch available, this is common for newly discovered vulnerabilities or packages that are not
actively maintained. Depending on the severity, we may choose to remove the dependency altogether and replace it with a
package with equivalent functionality. However, this is not always feasible or realistic, in those cases we can decide
to ignore the vulnerability if we judge that the vulnerability is negligible based on our use of the package.
Or maybe npm audit is just crying wolf, and we need to go about with our day.

As a last resort you can exclude a vulnerability using the `--exclude` option of the audit command found in
`./tools/audit.sh`:

```diff
 yarn run improved-yarn-audit \
   --min-severity moderate \
   --ignore-dev-deps \
-  --retry-on-network-failure
+  --retry-on-network-failure \
+  --exclude GHSA-93q8-gq69-wqmw
```
