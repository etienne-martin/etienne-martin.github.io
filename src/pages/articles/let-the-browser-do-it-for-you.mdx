# Let the browser do it for you

![a browser](/browser.png)

Browsers are an *incredible* piece of engineering. Heavy listing, re-invent the wheel.

This is a **non-exhaustive** list.

- Mention that it's not always possible to rely on the techniques highlighted here if you have an isomorphic application.
- scroll snapping
- encryption
- smooth scrolling

Mention that it's not always possible to rely on the techniques highlighted here if you have an isomorphic application.

The advantage of these approaches:

No need to add yet another library which would increase the size of your JavaScript bundle.

- Robustness.
- Speed.

### Images Lazy Loading

This one's pretty new so it's not fully supported by every browser. As of this writing, Safari is still lagging behind. Even though not every browser support, it can still be a good progressive enhancement.
data-src, the disadvantage of such approach is that…

```html
<img src="..." width="100" height="100" alt="..." loading="lazy" />
```

### Removing Accents/Diacritics in a String

```javascript
const removeAccents = (str) => {
  return str.normalize("NFD").replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, "");
};

const output = removeAccents("Hétérogénéité");
```

### HTML String Encoding

- using a [textNode](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createTextNode)
- using a [link to another page](/) with a piece of `inline code`

We sometimes need to sanitize untrusted strings, these are usually strings of text that are provided by users. This technique helps to prevent XSS attacks by encoding strings before rendering them into our document.

If you look on the internet for how to html-encode a piece of text, you will mostly find answers that involves regexes. Personally, the more I can stay away from regexes, the better. I'm not saying rexeges should be avoided at all cost but it's just that they get thrown around a lot and often they are not the right tool for the job.

If there's one thing browsers are good at, it's handling HTML.

```javascript
const htmlEncode = (str) => {
  const textarea = document.createElement("textarea");
  const textNode = document.createTextNode(str);

  textarea.appendChild(textNode);

  return textarea.innerHTML;
};

const htmlEncodedString = htmlEncode(
  `Hello world <img src="" onerror="alert('xss')" />`
);
```
